# engine-awm
Our internal typescript library, mainly used to develop Roblox game **Plane Engineers**.
It provides the backbone of the whole game, mainly with our Component system and a custom typescript transformer to simplify the development.

## Limitations
- **⚠️ Not supported**: This is our **internal** library. We might and will break, change or remove anything from it at any time.
- **⚠️ Experimental**: Still in active development, this library will have bugs or missing features.

## Using
If you still want to use this, you can use our project template at https://github.com/anywaymachines/framework-awm
